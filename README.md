# Voice-Command-to-Keyboard
I created this code to use your voice to recognize certain commands, and type out those commands on the keyboard

I'm using this to control video games on my computer with only my voice. 
The response time is a bit slow on the voice recognition, about 1 second, and I need to add a 0.2 second delay to the key presses to prevent my computer from crashing
